<p>The Allegany County Animal Shelter serves as the municipal shelter for Allegany County and is located at 716 Furnace Street in Cumberland. For many years, the shelter served as the final destination for nearly 85% of the animals that entered it. In late 2010, a group of passionate citizens led the charge to change the nature of the shelter with a goal of doing as much as possible for every animal, every day. It was the first step on the journey to becoming A Shelter of Hope.</p>
