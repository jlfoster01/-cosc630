      		<h5 class="card-title">Foster an Animal!</h5>
      		<p class="card-text">Foster Homes do make the difference between life and death for many stray, lost and abandoned animals. The Allegany County Animal Shelterâ€™s foster care program is designed to save lives by providing temporary care for animals in need. Fostering opens up spaces and cages and thereby allowing the shelter the ability to help more animals. It also provides animals help with socialization and training. Young or old, injured and sick, abused and under socialized animals receive a chance to grow or heal before finding their forever homes.</p>

      		<h5 class="card-title">Donate Your Skills and Experience!</h5>
      		<p class="card-text">Allegany County Animal Shelter needs help from those with specialized knowledge and skills. For example, those who love taking photos or making videos of animals could be a huge help in closing the gap between animals and adopters. It takes a lot of skill to photograph a dog who just wants to play catch! But if you can do it, your skills would definitely help animals find homes.
